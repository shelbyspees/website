Hi, I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer advocate, software engineer, and former English teacher dedicated to making the tech industry more accessible and equitable.

This site is both personal and professional. It's important to have boundaries, but I've found that it's impossible to completely separate my personal experiences from my work life. By sharing both, I hope to expose a human side of tech work.

You can probably find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shelbyspees). I also recently created a channel on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/shelbyspees).
