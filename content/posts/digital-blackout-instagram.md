This past weekend was a turning point in the fight for the abolition of police in the United States.
Then on Instagram this Tuesday, we witnessed the mass erasure of records of these historical events.

## Protests and support for abolition

The influx of support for abolishing law enforcement is due to a convergence of important factors:

- modern phones make it possible for the Black community to easily record and share high-definition video evidence of the chronic, systemic nature of anti-Black violence by law enforcement
- social media facilitates that sharing at unprecedented scale and rapidity
- Black Americans are already significantly more likely to die from coronavirus, and they've been disproportionately impacted by CoVID workforce reductions
- speaking of workforce reductions, a huge number of people out of work means that there are more people with time to protest

Thus, for the first time in my lifetime, non-Black Americans are seeing a flood of extremely credible records of police violence against peaceful protestors.
It's now illogical for non-Black Americans to shrug off stories of police violence as "a few bad apples" (as if that means anything), like we could in the past.
