Hey you!
Do you wanna subtly advocate for remote work accessibility
in a way that can help a lot of people?

Here's how you can help:
**Let people know when their audio quality sucks.**

It doesn't have to be a big diversion.
Just drop a quick, specific heads-up.

<!-- more -->

Here's a template for you:

> "Hey just a heads up,
> I'm getting a lot of echo/you're cutting out/you sound really quiet/there's a lot of background noise.
> I'm okay for right now, but you definitely ought to try and fix that before your next meeting."

Now, most people will want to fix it in the moment.
Don't stop them from trying one or two things.
In the next section, I share some low-hanging-fruit fixes that are appropriate to suggest when it's worth taking a minute to improve audio quality.
But it's easy to get sidetracked, so be sure to timebox the troubleshooting process.
There's probably a specific reason you're on a call with this person in the first place and it sucks to have to reschedule.

## troubleshooting in the moment

Here are a few band-aid fixes that can help most people slightly improve their audio in the moment.

**Turn off your mic when you're not speaking.**
Often the person introducing background noise into your call isn't the person speaking or presenting, and they may not even realize that their mic is hot.
If you can't get them to mute (maybe this person left the mic hot before walking away from their computer), Zoom meeting owners can mute them.

**Don't use airpods or bluetooth earbuds as a mic.**
Yes they're convenient, but they do a terrible job of picking up what you're saying.
Even the built-in mic on most laptops is better than airpods.
To fix this in Zoom: Change your audio input to "Macbook Pro Microphone"
or whatever the equivalent is for your computer.

**If you're cutting out, turn off video.**
Oftentimes, audio quality drops because of bandwidth issues.
Turning off your video means you're saving your connection all that uploading work,
leaving much more room for your audio to come through at higher quality.
Zoom also recently added a feature where you can block incoming video to free up some bandwidth.

**Close doors and windows.**
I used to live on a busy street so I get how hard it is to control for traffic noise.
Still, if you can deal with a few minutes in a stuffy room, please close your window.
The same is true when the noise is coming from inside the house.
If you have the luxury of being able to work in a room with a door that closes, please close it.
Your listeners will thank you.

**Turn off fans, a/c, etc.**
If you can't, move them away from your mic or move your mic/laptop away from the source.
Airflow sounds can come through super loud on mics, covering up your speaking with frustrating white noise.
This is why [microphone windscreens]() are a thing.
Of course, sometimes running Zoom can cause your laptop to heat up, making your fans start spinning in to try to cool it back down.
It's not trivial to fix this in the space of a few minutes at the beginning of a call,
but if you're running another application that tends to use a lot of resources (ahem, Docker for Mac),
quitting that can give your computer a break.

## testing your sound

Zoom has a long [support article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362283-Testing-computer-or-device-audio)
detailing how to test your audio, but here's the short version for Mac users:

- open the Zoom app
- hit `command` + `,` (comma) to open Zoom settings
- hit `a` to go to the audio tab (you can tell I do this a lot)
- ensure your desired mic is selected in the dropdown
- ensure your desired headphones are plugged in and selected in the dropdown

cool, now we're gonna do two different tests.

first: does Zoom hear you?

- _without_ clicking the "Test Mic" button, talk into your mic
- the bar thingy should fill up and go from red to green

second: how do you sound?

- this time, click on the "Test Mic" button (only once!)
- speak briefly into your mic
- after a couple seconds, Zoom will automatically play back the recording

If hearing your own voice makes you cringe, [you're not alone!](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/12/the-real-reason-the-sound-of-your-own-voice-makes-you-cringe)
But I'm going to gently ask you to suck it up and listen to yourself a few times.

## upgrades

With so much complexity involves in returning to offices or going hybrid,
acoustics may not be front-of-mind for company leadership.

If you're a remote worker, ask your manager about expensing the equipment and software I suggest here.

If you regularly need to be heard and understood in meetings, classes,
or any other speaking events, you need a dedicated mic.

The [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/)
has become ubiquitous among tech folks who do regular speaking engagements,
but you don't need a high-end podcast mic to sound better than the built-in mic on your laptop.
Even a $20 USB mic will be an improvement over your laptop's mic.

[Krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai) is a service that filters background noise during calls.
What's especially great is that it works in both directions.

## systemic change

Of course, the biggest problem with remote work audio quality issues
is that most people can't control their remote work environment.
The majority of workers stuck at home because of the pandemic
(as opposed to those who specifically chose a remote role)
have to carry on meetings in noisy, distracting environments
with minimal noise reduction

## why do I care?

I have audio processing issues that I only started learning about in the past few years.
They've actually been causing me issues since childhood,
but I think :
watching shows with headphones and/or subtitles,
choosing quiet places to hang out with friends,
chatting over text.
In adulthood, however, I've been finding myself in more situations
in which I need to listen carefully to what someone is saying
over moderate background noise I can't control.
Whether it's trying to have a conversation with my partner while walking next to car traffic,
or trying to listen to a coworker explain some technical thing
in an echoey open office with minimal acoustic treatment and several loud kitchen appliances.

It became really noticable in 2019 after my partner and I started dating.
I ended up getting my hearing checked because I was that worried about it.
Apparently I have excellent hearing ðŸ¤·
Better than average for high pitches!
It was a relief, but it wasn't until I learned about auditory processing disorders
that my struggles made sense.
