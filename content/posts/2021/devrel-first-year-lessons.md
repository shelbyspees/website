## Lessons Learned

### Basic Shit Matters

How many times do I need to relearn the most basic shit??

- sleep is important
- nutrition is important
- hydration is important
- exercise is important, if only for getting oxygen to my brain
- taking my meds consistently is important

### Executive Dysfunction is Real

And I need help overcoming it, or else it compounds.
Work or housework or paperwork will pile up and become an overwhelming ordeal.

Housework debt in particular compounds really fast
and it seems to be the most insidious because of the ripple effects.

### Rallying / Powering Through Has a Cost



### I'm Unreliable and It's a Problem

I don't finish the things I started.

### It May Also Be a Sign

When I can't focus

### Sometimes I'm Wrong About What's Important

### But Other Times I'm Right

### Writing Will Always Be Hard For Me

### But I'm Still Pretty Good At It

### My Skills Have Atrophied

### But I Still Got It

I'm more technical than I think I am.

It's easy to focus on the gaps in my knowledge and experience,
especially when I'm surrounded by staff- and principal-level engineers.
