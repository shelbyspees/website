I just want Hugo themes that use semantic HTML
and meet accessibility standards out of the box.
Is that so much to ask?

<!--more-->

## Disclaimer(s)

I don't claim to be the arbiter of what is or isn't accessible.
There are web accessibility experts out there, please listen to them.
I'm just trying to apply the standards I'm aware of
and maybe convince more people to care about making their content accessible.

I'm also not a frontend web developer.
There's a lot I don't know.
I fully expect I've said something inaccurate in this post.
Please [reach out via Twitter](https://twitter.com/shelbyspees)
with any corrections or feedback.

One thing I can say with some confidence is that accessibility isn't binary.
A change that makes content more accessible to some
can make the same content less accessible to others.
For example, people with low vision can benefit from higher color contrast,
but high contrast can trigger migraines for people with light sensitivity.

Still, the standards and practices I'm referencing in this post
are the result of decades of research by web accessibility experts.
They've written these standards while considering
the tradeoffs between conflicting accessibility needs
in order to make web content accessible to as many people as possible.
I doubt I could do much better than that with my limited knowledge,
so while they're not perfect, I think these standards are worth following.

Finally, I realize that the Hugo theme on my personal site
doesn't even use semantic HTML consistently.
It's better than it was, sure, but I still have some work to do.

## `hugo new .`

I set up a couple new [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) sites
the past few months---most recently [ADHDevOps.club](https://adhdevops.club).
With the desire to just set something up quickly,
Hugo made the most sense since I have a decent amount of experience with it.
Unfortunately, it's been a bit frustrating trying to choose Hugo themes
because very few of them both suit my needs for the site
and actually meet accessibility standards.

I started using Hugo a few years ago
after switching my personal site from Jekyll.
We also use Hugo for [the docs site at Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io),
so I've had the opportunity to become relatively familiar it.
It seems like Hugo got popular around 2016-2017---at least
that's when a lot of the themes I looked at were created.

For ADHDevOps specifically, I wanted a Hugo blog theme
that passed the WAVE accessibility checker's requirements (tested with the
[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)),
and could support a few specific features I wanted
without having to overwrite more than a couple of the theme's templates.
The features I wanted include:

- custom home page content (not just a list of posts)
- blog post author set in the front matter to allow for many guest authors
- tags and/or categories (these usually come out of the box)
- static non-blog-post pages
- clean, minimal design
- light and dark mode
- colors meet contrast requirements for accessibility

In general, Hugo makes it relatively easy to accomplish the things on my list.
But many of the themes I looked at had hard-coded paths or layouts,
making it hard to build on otherwise high-quality, simple styles.
In the end, I couldn't find a single theme that checked all of these boxes
without having to overwrite a bunch of the layouts
and/or completely change the CSS--usually both.

On top of that, I'd see redundant CSS classes everywhere:
`.main`, `.section`, `.nav`--many of which were modifying `div` elements.
Maybe semantic HTML wasn't as much of a thing in 2016?
I mean, I remember learning about semantic elements in HTML5
back when I first dug into the MDN docs in 2015 ðŸ¤·

In any case, it's 2021 now.
Web assessibility has been around for a while, right?
My own curiosity piqued, I went and looked it up: how recent is all this?

It turns out that version 2.0 of the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
were published in 2008 and became ISO standard in 2012.
HTML5 was also released in 2008 and given "W3C Recommendation" status in 2014.

Compare that to WebAssembly, which was first announced in 2015
and only reached "W3C Recommendation" status in 2019.
My unscientific feeling (informed by the reality of the tech industry)
is that there are frontend dev teams seriously debating
rewriting their sites to use WebAssembly when they never once considered
investing equivalent (or less!) time and resources
to meet accessibility standards established a decade ago.

C'mon, folks. We're long overdue.
Semantic HTML should be considered basic website hygiene.
Especially on a static site, FFS.

## Overwriting Hugo themes

One thing to know about Hugo is that themes are traditionally set up
by adding them to your site repo as [Git submodules]().
More modern themes allow you to import them as [Go/Hugo modules](),
but the themes I was looking at hadn't been updated in several years.

## The themes I looked at

The first theme I picked was [Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-book/).
I was imagining that the ADHDevOps site would eventually grow
into a sort of wiki, a reference guide for
all the great ADHD content and tools out there.
I thought a site more oriented toward technical documentation made sense,
and I liked how the Book theme behaved like a sort of blank slate.

Unfortunately, this theme kept pretty much all its content
under a hard-coded `/docs` path.
To remove `/docs` from the URL
I would have had to overwrite nearly all the layouts!
(Now that I think about it, there's probably a way to fix this
using the site config...welp too late now.)
At this point I'd only published the site's intro post,
so even though I already knew I wanted to change the theme
I let it sit for a week and chewed on how to proceed.

Then I was looking at [Anubis]().
This is the theme used as an example in Hugo's quick start documentation.
I was _hoping_ this would mean that the theme would be flexible
and meet accessibility standards.
Yeah no.

I briefly considered [???]() alongside Anubis
After editing the layouts a bit and rebasing to isolate theme-specific changes,
I set up branch deploys for each and decided I liked Anubis better.
Plus, ??? would have required even more custom layout and styling
than either Book or Anubis---(???)'s color contrast was abysmal.
I was really trying to avoid overwriting all the CSS.
Oh, sweet summer child...

In comparison, Anubis met slightly more of my requirements.
The dark/light theme toggle was great,
plus it only required a single-line config change to enable.
While the color contrast in dark mode was slightly _too_ high,
it was easy enough to overwrite the background color to make it more muted.
I didn't love the top navbar but I didn't want to overthink it either.

Unfortunately, Anubis didn't spark joy.
I felt the urge to keep searching for the perfect theme.

The next day I found [Ezhil]().
I've always been a fan of the [Raleway font]()---I've since updated
the body font on my personal site to use Raleway as well.
I tried Ezhil out on localhost and it felt _right_.
Unfortuntely it was a Monday and I had actual work to do.
The new theme sat uncommitted in my index for a week
before I carved out my Saturday afternoon to try deploying the change.

Migration isn't a huge deal on simple Hugo sites,
but I had just spent the previous weekend overwriting layouts
for two entirely different themes.
I had custom code everywhere.
I generally don't mind deleting code that much,
but after all that fiddling I wanted to feel confident about my choice.

After several hours of overwriting layouts and CSS once again
(this theme didn't even use a preprocessor!)
and getting annoyed about `<div class="main">`,
it finally hit me: no theme is going to check all my boxes.
I'm just too picky.

## Fuck it, I'll fork it

{{% tweet 1391480701489278980 %}}

[The fork](https://github.com/adhdevops/ezhil) lives in the ADHDevOps org.
Let's walk through some of my changes.

[This commit](https://github.com/adhdevops/ezhil/commit/bc6f8d348d75ee9eb971789247b92ea29c32141f)
is where I started switching to semantic HTML tags for `main` and `section`,
although its true purpose was to factor out the base document tags.
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag and other base tags were hard-coded into
each of the four page layouts, which I really only noticed because
the WAVE evaluation tool found issues there--mainly that
the opening `<html>` tag was missing a value for the language attribute.
I was surprised by this after trying out several themes
with built-in features for internationalization,
but I guess the Ezhil theme was meant to be minimal.
I was committed to this fork now, though, so I felt it made the most sense
to DRY up the layouts.

I had already factored out a `list-element` partial for the home page's
list of Recent posts, which included some post metadata like publish date
and whether the post is a draft.
(Apparently I did that refactor as
[part of the above commit](https://github.com/adhdevops/ezhil/commit/bc6f8d348d75ee9eb971789247b92ea29c32141f#diff-5f94de6d6f1f71be7e6352098044a189896abf19a6a20f85c494d008702afe35R1-R15),
which is not very hygenic!
Feel free to judge the crap out of me.)
This refactor was not necessary to DRY up the code,
since the post list is only used on the home page (at least for now).
It's more that too many levels of indentation make me anxious ðŸ˜…,
so I pulled that chunk out to make it easier (for me!) to debug
when I inevitably access some YAML data incorrectly and break the build.

This next feature I wanted was to render the author's name
(and other info like pronouns and website)
in the Recent posts list and on individual posts.
Here's how I set that data up in the post front matter:

```diff
  ---
  title: "Introducing ADHDevOps.club!"
  date: 2021-04-30T10:56:31-07:00
  slug: introducing
  tags: ["community"]
+ author:
+   name: Shelby Spees
+   url: https://shelbyspees.com
+   pronouns: "she/they"
  ---
```

I needed to update both the Recent post list and the single post layout
to access this new data in the front matter.
With three new parameters to check for, I felt better pulling the code out
into a new
[`post-meta` partial](https://github.com/adhdevops/ezhil/commit/2279f8b823adc1d07c1c6f96e242c951786b5255):

```html
<section class="meta">
  <date>{{ dateFormat "1 Jan 2006" .Date | upper }}</date>  
  {{ if .Params.Author.name }}
  &nbsp;Â·&nbsp;
    {{ if .Params.Author.url }}
      <a href="{{ .Params.Author.url }}">
      {{ .Params.Author.name | upper }}
      </a>
    {{ else}}
      {{ .Params.Author.name | upper }}
    {{ end }}
    {{ if .Params.Author.pronouns }}
        ({{ .Params.Author.pronouns }}) 
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
  {{ if .Draft }} <span class="draft-label">DRAFT</span> {{ end }}
</section>
```

(TODO more content here)

Finally, I removed Disqus entirely---I've never used it.
If I want to add comments I'd rather try (FIXME this new service)
that has you sign in via GitHub, which IMO would be the smoothest experience
for the site's target audience: very online tech workers.

## Project maintainers have a responsibility

I think the main thing that frustrates me about all this
is the lack of accessible themes on this list.
Hugo is still wildly popular, and in listing themes on the website
they're tacitly recommending that people create new sites with them.

Now, I don't blame Hugo's maintainers for no longer accepting new themes
to list on the site.
I've noticed that the majority of themes listed on the Hugo site sit in repos
that haven't been touched for years.
It seems like the maintainers have moved on to newer projects
and Hugo's theme library sort of remains as a time capsule
from its peak period of popularity.

But what I'd love to see from maintainers of static site generators like Hugo
is for them to start requiring that any theme they point to on their website
at the very least uses semantic HTML and passes the WAVE accessibility checker.

Here's hoping that newer frameworks like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev)
(pronounced "eleventy") do a better job of meeting these standards.
I'm planning to dig around in 11ty's themes and see how it compares
to my experiences with Hugo and Jekyll.

And if you come across better lists of Hugo themes than what's on the Hugo site,
hit me up so I can share them.
I don't expect the average new-Hugo-site-creator to bother looking anywhere
besides the main Hugo site when searching for themes,
but maybe we can make more accessible alteratives rise up in search results.
