abstract:
- because of the accessibility of web dev learning, we're going to see more non-CS grad programmers than non-CS grad sysadmins this next decade
- maybe a pre-SRE path can exist, like pre-med. lots of paths into the medical field, even if the majority are e.g. bio majors
- but also: shouldn't everyone be invested in reliability? like shifting security left, we should shift reliability left? why does junior SRE need to be its own role?
- on-call (and other forms of service ownership) is a crucial stepping stone for reaching senior-ness. breaking down the wall between writing code and operating it should be our top priority (disclaimer: I've never been paged at night)

- SRE looks different at every company, and there's often a huge difference between work-as-imagined and work-as-done
- I highly value creating entry paths to rewarding tech roles that circumvent traditional gatekeeping bullshit

## We should value expertise

As Charity and Amy both point out

## Enough time in the day?
