After months of putting off ordering them, I bought the stickers I wanted and they finally arrived!  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒˆ

You'll note the black hard-shell case I have on my macbook, basically because I'm scared of the ridiculously smooth metal of an uncovered macbook and how I'm definitely gonna drop this $2000 laptop.
Plus I feel weird putting stickers directly on a laptop, it's like putting bumper stickers directly on a car (another sin in my mind, I guess).
And as a bonus, the black background really makes the stickers pop.
