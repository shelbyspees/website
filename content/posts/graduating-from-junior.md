I cling to this image of myself as junior, as a noob, as not very knowledgeable. It's holding me back, hurting my individual work performance as well as hurting those I'm best positioned to help.

In the beginning, I leaned heavily on being able to play the "intern" card in order to ask questions. That turned into the "junior" card when I got hired full-time.

It's become a habit, especially in my weird bumpy path where I was jumping around wildly different domains my first three years, so I never sat with the same shit long enough to deepen my skills.

Some of my mindset around "junior" status could also have been influenced by Aerospace culture, where anything less than 10 years of experience is considered early career. Not exaggerating. They have programs around this notion.

Are we talking junior developer...advocate? Or junior...developer advocate?

Honeycomb doesn't hire early-career folks into the Developer Advocate role.
