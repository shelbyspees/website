Hi there 👋  
I'm Shelby. (pronouns: she/her or they/them)  
I live in Los Angeles, CA with my pitbull, [Nova](/nova) 🐾 💜

## 🐝 work 🥑

I've been developing software professionally since 2015, after going back to school to take online computer science classes.
Since then I've been lucky to work in a range of domains and with lots of wonderful people. [Check out my resume.](/resume/)

Currently I work as a Developer Advocate at <a href="https://honeycomb.io/" target="_blank">Honeycomb↗️</a>.
My job involves spreading the word about observability, helping people get the most out of Honeycomb, and sharing valuable user feedback with our product team.
I also work on the <a href="https://honeycomb.io/blog/" target="_blank">Honeycomb blog↗️</a> and <a href="https://o11y.fm" target="_blank">o11ycast↗️</a>!

- read <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/author/shelby/" target="_blank">posts I've written for the Honeycomb blog↗️</a>
- request slides from a talk I've given at my <a href="https://honeycomb.io/shelby/" target="_blank">Honeycomb speaker page↗️</a>
- check out my <a href="https://speaking.shelbyspees.com/" target="_blank">speaker portfolio↗️</a>

## 🎤 fun 🎵

here are some of my informal music goals:

- learn to stream karaoke without using Twitch Sings
- join an orchestra again
- join a classic rock cover band as the lead singer
- perform [Postmodern Jukebox↗️](https://postmodernjukebox.com/) covers in a jazz club like some kind of lounge singer
