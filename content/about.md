## 💻 work 🥑

I've been developing software professionally since 2015, after going back to school to take online computer science classes. Since then I've been lucky to work in a range of domains and with lots of wonderful people.

Currently I work as a Developer Advocate at [Honeycomb](http://honeycomb.io/). My job involves spreading the word about observability, helping people get the most out of Honeycomb, and sharing valuable user feedback with our product team. I also work on the [Honeycomb blog](http://honeycomb.io/blog/) and [o11ycast](http://o11y.fm/)!
