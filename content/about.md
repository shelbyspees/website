Hi there 👋 I'm Shelby. (pronouns: she/her or they/them)

## personal 💜🐾

I live in Los Angeles, CA with my pitbull, [Nova](/nova).

If you want to be penpals, you can email me at `shelby at hey.com`, but I'm kinda bad about responding 😓. Really, the best way to reach me for non-work stuff is on [twitter](http://twitter.com/shelbyspees). Hit me up! 

## work 💻🥑

I've been developing software professionally since 2015, after going back to school to take online computer science classes. Since then I've been lucky to work in a range of domains and with lots of wonderful people.

Currently I work as a Developer Advocate at [Honeycomb](http://honeycomb.io/). My job involves spreading the word about observability, helping people get the most out of Honeycomb, and sharing valuable user feedback with our product team. I also work on the [Honeycomb blog](http://honeycomb.io/blog/) and [o11ycast](http://o11y.fm/)!

- schedule time during my [office hours](https://honeycomb.io/meet/shelby/)
- request slides from a talk I've given: [honeycomb.io/shelby](https://honeycomb.io/shelby/)
- reach out directly: `shelby at honeycomb.io`
