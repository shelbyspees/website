Hi, I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer advocate and software engineer dedicated to making the tech industry more accessible and equitable.

You can probably find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shelbyspees), plus I recently started streaming on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/shelbyspees).

## work

The majority of my past work is private, but I'll share more here as it happens.

I wrote a blog post introducing myself when I started my current job: [*Right at Home in My New Role*](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/right-at-home-in-my-new-role/). You can also check out [my other posts on the Honeycomb blog](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/author/shelby/).
