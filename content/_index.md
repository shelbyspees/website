Hi, I'm Shelby ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer advocate, software engineer, and former English teacher dedicated to making the tech industry more accessible and equitable.

You can probably find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shelbyspees), and I recently started streaming on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/shelbyspees).

## writing

I wrote a blog post introducing myself when I started my current job: [***Right at Home in My New Role***](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/right-at-home-in-my-new-role/).

You can also [check out my other posts on the Honeycomb blog](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/author/shelby/).
