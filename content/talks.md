## Fast and Simple: Observing Code and Infra Deployments at Honeycomb

### Abstract

> You don’t need Kubernetes to automatically push green builds to production---learn how Honeycomb has leveraged CircleCI, Terraform, Chef, a handful of home-grown scripts, and Honeycomb itself to speed up its deployments and make them safer. 
> You’ll also hear about what went wrong along the way, and how Honeycomb used our Service Level Objectives to evaluate and mitigate the risks.
