title: "Threads"

I've been using Twitter since around 2012. It's been the source of some important lessons for me, based on real people's actual life experiences. Plus, it's where I first learned about observability and Honeycomb.

The Twitter thread is a unique medium that's especially suited for both readers and writers who struggle with focus and executive function. If that describes you, I hope you get something out of the threads I've shared here.
