I've been using Twitter since around 2012. It's been the source of some important lessons for me, based on real people's actual life experiences. Plus, it's where I first learned about observability and Honeycomb.

The Twitter thread is a unique medium that's especially suited for both readers and writers who struggle with focus and executive function. If that describes you, I hope you get something out of the threads I've shared here.

If you'd like me to live-tweet an event you're holding, I can do so in my capacity as a developer advocate! Reach out: `shelby at honeycomb.io`.
