I have audio processing issues that I only started learning about in the past few years.

They've actually been causing me issues since childhood,
but I'd subconsciously accommodate for it:
watching shows with headphones and/or subtitles,
choosing quiet places to hang out with friends,
chatting over text.
In adulthood, however, I've been finding myself in more situations
in which I need to listen carefully to what someone is saying
over moderate background noise I can't control.

It became really noticable in 2019 after my partner and I started dating.
Trying to have a conversation with him while out walking next to car traffic was impossible.
I'd also struggle trying to listen to a coworker explain some technical thing
in an echoey open office with several loud kitchen appliances.

I ended up getting my hearing checked because I was that worried about it.
Apparently I have excellent hearing ðŸ¤·.
It was a relief, but it wasn't until I learned about auditory processing disorders
that my struggles made sense.
