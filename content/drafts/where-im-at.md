As I announced [on Twitter last month](https://twitter.com/shelbyspees/status/1403426348463321088),
I'm no longer at Honeycomb.
So whatâ€™s next for me?
I've given it a lot of thought.

<!-- more -->

I've been writing this blog post for weeks now.
It's been hard for me to articulate what I'm looking for
and I keep rambling at people on Zoom calls (sorry!).
This is my attempt to linearize my thoughts
and have a slightly better elevator pitch
so that I can at least spare people from my rambling.

Originally I was only going to write about my career goals,
but I keep having trouble talking about my goals
without talking about my work history.

I realized that before I can fully consider my career goals,
I need to take inventory of where I am now and how I got here.

## Where I'm at

I started working as a full-time software engineer in 2015,
so this September marks six years of "experience."
But those six years involved a lot of context switches and interruptions,
so my experience has turned out to be [more broad than deep](/resume).
Sure, there's no "right way" to do a career.
But I don't think my work history so far
has gotten me to the level of a senior engineer
and I'm a little self-conscious about it.

For example: I've never spent more than a year and a half in a single codebase,
which means I haven't had the opportunity to go through
the "learning from my own (system design) mistakes" rite of passage.

My first job had me working on multiple projects at once,
often in completely unrelated domains.
Because of the way budgets worked there,
there were times when I was allocated
five hours per week on four different small projects,
with the remainder going toward a larger project.
It would take me most of those five hours to spin up context
and then I'd have to put it down again until the next week.
My output was abysmal.

It's only this year that I learned that I'm only good at context-switching
when the context I'm switching to is something I know well.
Context switching between things I'm trying to learn
while also being expected to complete projects?
It's a recipe for failure.

My new guideline:
On my own, I can learn a new domain or a new tech stack, but not both.
Preferably, I wouldn't be on my own for any of it.
