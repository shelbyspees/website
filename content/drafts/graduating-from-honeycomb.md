On Friday I announced that I was leaving Honeycomb.

I waited until after [o11ycon+hnycon](https://o11ycon-hnycon.io) to say anything
so that I wouldn't distract from the event.

## Why change roles?

There were parts of the Developer Advocate that I really excelled at,
like giving talks and helping customers directly.
But other parts were always a struggle for me.
The content creation workload was never going to let up.
It's important work that I _wanted_ to be good at,
but it never got easier and my struggles were putting an undue burden on my teammates.

(Props to all my devrel friends who can keep up with the content creation demands of the role!
I admire that a ton!)


### Did you know that writing is hard?

I've struggled with writing since...ever.

As a kid, my mom routinely had to get extensions for me on essays and writing projects.
For the majority of in-class essays I'd be turning in a blank page, or maybe a couple sentences.

It was only in the past six months or so


 certain kinds of writing come easily to me,
like internal process documentation.
I documented the shit out of our blog pipeline process while I was in charge of it,
and that made onboarding a dedicated content marketer go way more smoothly.


But other types of writing were like pulling teeth:
blog posts, whitepapers, book chapters.
I was hoping that they would get easier with time
but it was basically always an uphill battle.

## Why leave Honeycomb?

I did consider moving to a different team at Honeycomb.

In April I started 6-week rotation on the telemetry team (formerly known as the integrations team).

With Paul planning to move to the platform team, headhount opened up in telemetry
and I seriously considered applying for the open role.


It was my first time pairing regularly (if informally) on dev work
and I loved it.


The rotation gave me a taste of the things I miss about programming,
but I found myself more interested in the example apps than in the SDKs.
I wanted a running system to pick apart and learn.
I craved the feedback loop of production (you know, that thing we'd always talk about),
and working on integrations wasn't going to satisfy that.



What makes a good telemetry/instrumentation/integrations engineer?

While I care a lot about developer experience and API design,
I could tell I was making decisions based on 

I haven't been on the user side for long enough to 
    

## But you've done so much cool DevRel work!

Listen: You can take the dev out of DevRel, but you can’t take the DevRel out of the dev.
I’ll still be loud on Twitter.
I plan to continue writing and even speaking.
I just won’t make that stuff a part of my job responsibilities.

It's already a lot less scary to write on my personal blog when I'm just accountable to myself
rather than tacitly acting as the public face of a whole company.
I don't have that voice in the back of my head
