<!-- more -->

I've always had difficulty nailing down my career goals.
The problem is that I'm a generalist.
I've always been interested in everything.

This presents a particular challenge
when most teams are looking for experienced specialists.
I genuinely wonder if I'm incapable of specializing.

## The goal

I want to learn a system

It's been a challenge to speak as an authority on software engineering practices
because in a lot of ways, I am babby.
While I've been writing code that other people use (for their work even!) since 2015,
I've never lived in a single codebase for more than 18 months.
Changing projects so often has made me comfortable reading code in many languages
but it hasn't made me an expert in anything.

People talk about [T-shaped developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills),
how that's what you should strive to be.
I've always felt more like an [em-dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/)-shaped engineer.
Since I find so many topics interesting,
I'm probably a bit more knowledgeable about those areas than the average person.
But I haven't developed deep expertise in any one area.

(I do like the term proposed in
[this blog post](https://killalldefects.com/2020/02/22/specializing-vs-generalizing-careers/):
the "comb-shaped" developer.)

### My experience is relevant

Now I've swung toward the DevRel side of the pendulum and back.
I talked to many people about their engineering work.
Learning about what other folks are working on made me realize
how much of my experience is highly technical.
I still have to continually remind myself that even if my existing skills
aren't directly applicable on a new team or project,
the fundamentals still apply.
My experience has carry-over.

I feel like I'm on the precipice of a lot of very deep knowledge.
I've witnessed many solution patterns now, but without firsthand experience
hacking at the problems they're trying to solve.

### A Shelby-shaped role

Another thing I've been thinking about:
I want to be sure to join an org that will appreciate
the fact that I'm drawn toward glue work.

<!-- all-in-one glue -->
{{% tweet 1403503964910276608 %}}

Unfortunately, my gluey-ness can conflict with my desire
for deep technical knowledge.
I only have so many hours in a day to learn and sharpen my skills.

When my SRE role models like
[Liz](https://twitter.com/lizthegrey) and
[Amy](https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey) and
[Paul](https://twitter.com/paulosman) and
[Fred](https://twitter.com/mononqc)
write up an incident review document
or get the right people talking to each other to make a decision,
there is no doubt about their technical chops.
They've long since demonstrated not only the required knowledge
but also the ability to execute.

It's harder for me to demonstrate that ability
because I haven't racked up as many hours doing hands-on engineering work.
Trivially, because I haven't been working in tech for as long as them,
but also because I've experienced a bunch of interruptions throughout my career
that essentially reset the clock on my learning.
