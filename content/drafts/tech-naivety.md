Thinking about how in a couple years I jumped from "hello world" and "ssh? what's that?" to trying (and failing) to learn Grindr's network architecture.
Wtf was I thinking? ðŸ˜­
I spent much of that job not really understanding what people meant when they talked about deploys.
It took me another solid year to make sense of what a load balancer was for. (Especially since you can't trust names to make sense in this field!)

At my first internship, people talked about servers and I nodded along, but it would be several more years before I really grokked what servers are actually for.

I just couldn't wrap my head around services--software that I couldn't see or touch. Like, desktop applications made sense to me. Static websites made sense. But web applications were a mystery for a reeeeaaaally long time. I also started out writing code (mostly python and c++) in isolation without really thinking about how people would run it

It's so funny cause I loved computers growing up. 
I asked for a laptop every birthday and Christmas starting around age 8. 
My dad's best friend built two computers for my parents as well as my first desktop computer, which I got at age 14 (first laptop was at age 18 in college). 
The main reason why I didn't consider majoring in CS during my undergrad was because ITT Tech and DeVry commercials made me think studying computers was a scam.
I just conflated the whole thing.

Also, my dad's friend lived with his parents so I didn't think working with computers could be that lucrative.
I'm pretty sure my parents told me not to follow in his footsteps.

The era of STEM started right at the end of high school for me, and by then I'd spent years believing that computer jobs weren't good jobs.
