This post was prompted by someone asking about alternatives to the word "user,"
but my answer applies in any situation in which a writer is trying to
avoid using an undesirable or offensive term.

## When in doubt: rephrase

I find that it's often easiest to just rephrase the whole sentence.

I think most people try too hard to find a perfect 1:1 replacement of the term
with the exact same semantics.
That's usually not needed.
In prose, it's often possible to flip the sentence around and avoid the word entirely.

## What about in code?

There are some situations in which a 1:1 replacement of the term _is_ needed
and the semantics _are_ very important, like in code.
That's when I'll break out the thesaurus.

Yes, naming things is hard.
I believe it gets easier with practice and care.

Part of the problem is peopleÂ often prematurely conclude that
any conversation about names is bikeshedding and a waste of time.

While it can certainly happen that way,
I don't think it's a waste to take an extra bit of time
thinking (and talking!) about your project/class/function/variable/parameter name.
A good name can support and improve you and your team's mental model of the system.

Every implementation detail in code is a design decision.
