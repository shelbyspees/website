It's been a little over a year since I joined Honeycomb as a Developer Advocate.
This has been a hell of a year and I think it's a story worth sharing.

<!--more-->

The actual anniversary was on March 23rd, but I gave myself some flexibility
because I knew I wouldn't be able to get to this right away.
It wasn't until I randomly started tinkering with my [resume](/resume/) today
while trying out [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io)
that I felt the shape of the story coming together.

For my wins, I had already drafted a lot of these bullets for my resume
before deciding they're way too verbose.
In my next post I'll be sharing some of the more noteworthy challenges I faced,
and I'd like to write up a third with a few lessons I've learned about myself
and my working style.

## What I've Accomplished

I loved seeing folks share their wins at the end of 2020!
This post can be my four-months-belated version of that ðŸ˜…
Note that I'm only capturing accomplishments from March 2020 to March 2021,
so this doesn't include the most recent projects I've been working on.

Forgive the bullets--it's easiest to treat this like a verbose resume
rather than letting myself get bogged down editing prose.
