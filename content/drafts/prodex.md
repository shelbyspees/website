In "Shifting Left on Production Excellence with Observability," our keynote presentation at DevOps Enterprise Summit North America 2021, Liz Fong-Jones and I made an assertion:

> "All teams need production excellence."

I want to talk more about what that looks like.

I first learned the term from Liz Fong-Jones' 2019 InfoQ article: ["Sustainable Operations in Complex Systems with Production Excellence"](https://www.infoq.com/articles/production-excellence-sustainable-operations-complex-systems/). This was before I joined Honeycombâ€”I was working as a DevOps Engineer at a small adtech firm in LA. I was frustrated by things I saw on my team: the low [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor), which was exascerbated by upper management's resistance to prioritizing knowledge transfer.
