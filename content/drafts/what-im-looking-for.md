## Will I be supported?

I've been on projects where I basically had to teach myself like, everything.
In some cases it was because I was the first person to use that technology,
but more often it was because my experienced teammates didn't have bandwidth
for ongoing knowledge transfer.
Sometimes they didn't even have bandwidth for initial onboarding!

It's a waste if I'm spending hours or days trying to learn something on my own
if there's an experienced person around who could help me grok it
in a fraction of the time.

So I've been sharing that experience with interviewers,
especially in the context of wanting to grow into a senior.
I share a little bit about my work style,
how I learn fastest from talking to people,
and how I'm most motivated by doing work that helps others with their work.

In the context of all of that, I ask:

> How will this team be able to support my learning and growth,
> both during initial onboarding and longer term?

I want to onboard quickly.
I shouldn't be spending weeks trying to unbreak my dev environment on my own
because that's time I could be spending solving actual problems.
I also want to make sure I won't be left alone after that initial onboarding.

Finally, how can this team grow me into that senior engineer I want to be?
