Today is [Juneteenth](https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/historical-legacy-juneteenth),
which is officially a US federal holiday as of this week.
I'm using this occasion to apply my linguistics background
and share my appreciation for Black (American) English
by pointing to scholarship on the subject
from Black American linguists.

<summary>Disclaimer</summary>
I'm white.
I don't claim to be an ally.
I and all white people benefit from white supremacy,
which is systemic and still exists
when we're not engaging in explicitly racist behavior.
This blog post won't end white supremacy or linguistic profiling.

Also, I'm not at all suggesting that non-Black people
should try to speak Black dialects/sociolects.
Please don't appropriate Black English.

## A note on terminology

I'm using the umbrella term "Black English" (abbreviated "BE")
in favor of the commonly-used term "African-American Vernacular English" (abbreviated "AAVE").
I personally avoid using the term
["Ebonics"](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-ebonics-african-american-english)
because I was taught that it was a reductive term
that perpetuates prejudice against Black Americans.

## Black linguists and scholars

(Note: If I didn't find anything listing the person's preferred title,
I used "professor" for current and retired university professors,
and last names for anyone else.
I'm happy to update this post with any corrections.)

### John Baugh, Ph.D

[Professor John Baugh]((https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh))
is the foundational scholar on linguistic profiling.

In this
[radio show from 2018](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/show/st-louis-on-the-air/2018-09-04/wash-u-linguist-analyzes-american-dialects-discrimination),
Professor Baugh shared how he experienced linguistic profiling first-hand
while looking for apartments:

> Many people could not detect that Iâ€™m African American based on my speech,
> but I grew up in an inner city African American neighborhood
> and rather than sue the respective landlords that denied me housing,
> I began to conduct experiments in the San Francisco Bay Area
> and I would modify my dialect when I would be calling up for apartment.

Professor Baugh has also given this TED talk about linguistic profiling.

If you'd like to dive into some sociolinguistics reading,
Professor Baugh's 2002 book
[_Beyond Ebonics: Linguistic Pride and Racial Prejudice_](https://bookshop.org/books/beyond-ebonics-linguistic-pride-and-racial-prejudice/9780195152890):
looks especially promising (note: I haven't read it yet):

> John Baugh, a well-known African-American linguist and education expert,
> offers an accessible explanation of the origins of the term,
> the linguistic reality behind the hype,
> and the politics behind the outcry on both sides of the debate.
> Using a non-technical, first-person style,
> and bringing in many of his own personal experiences,
> Baugh debunks many commonly-held notions about
> the way African-Americans speak English,
> and the result is a nuanced and balanced portrait of a fraught subject.

[Raciolinguistics: How Language Shapes Our Ideas About Race](https://bookshop.org/books/raciolinguistics-how-language-shapes-our-ideas-about-race/9780197521106)

On top of his work on broader topics in sociolinguistics,
Professor Rickford has researched and written about
pidgin and creole languages in great detail.

His chapter in _The Oxford Handbook of African American Language_ (2015), titled
["The Creole Origins Hypothesis" (PDF link)](http://johnrickford.com/portals/45/documents/papers/Rickford%202015a%20The%20Creole%20Origins%20Hypothesis.pdf),
is a great example of sociolinguistics writing
and it's on a topic that many non-lingustics may still find interesting.
