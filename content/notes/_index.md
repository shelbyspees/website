This is my collection of informal, unpolished notes. The information gathered here may be incorrect or outdated. Use at your own discretion.
 
I enjoy taking notes as a learning tool for my own benefit. If you get something out of it, even better!

I especially enjoy taking notes during talks and panels. If I've done so for a talk of yours and you'd like me to take the page down for any reason, please contact me via email: `shelbyspees at gmail.com`.

If you'd like me to live-tweet or take live notes for an event you're holding, I can do so in my capacity as a developer advocate! Reach out: `shelby at honeycomb.io`.

For now, my notes are in no particular order. That may change in the future.
