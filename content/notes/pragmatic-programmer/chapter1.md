## 1. It's Your Life
Be proactive  
***Tip 3: You have agency***  
Invest in your learning outside of work

## 2. The Cat Ate My Source Code
Effective teams require trust  
Take responsibility and be accountable

***Tip 4: Provide options, don't make [bad] excuses***  
If you need to share bad news, provide options for going forward
- > Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Will they ask, “Have you tried this…” or “Didn’t you consider that?”
- See also: [This column will change your life: Are you an Asker or a Guesser?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)
- What else can be done?
- Be honest if you don't know

Challenge:
> When you find yourself saying, “I don’t know,” be sure to follow it up with “—but I’ll find out.” It’s a great way to admit what you don’t know, but then take responsibility like a pro.

## 3. Software Entropy
"Tech debt" is a euphemism for "software rot." It doesn't get fixed.

***Tip 5: Don't live with broken windows***  
- Important follow up: “If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up.”
- Communicate to future readers that you're on top of the situation
    - Even just a FIXME comment linking to a Jira ticket
- Neglect accelerates rot

Don't break windows even during an emergency.

## 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
"People find it easier to join an ongoing success." Get the ball rolling for other people to join in.

***Tip 6: Be a catalyst for change***  
Conversely, complex systems drift into failure without devs noticing.
> It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.

***Tip 7: Remember the big picture***

Ways to take stock, get situational awareness:
- linting
- test coverage
- hallway usability tests
- user surveys

Challenge: 
> Can you determine whether you're making stone soup or frog soup when you try to catalyze change?

both, depends on who you ask

important to mitigate harm

## 5. Good-Enough Software
"Good enough" != sloppy or poorly produced code
Understand user needs first, then decide where to spend effort

Tip 8: Make quality a requirements issue
> Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow.

note: "Great software" not "shitty duct-tape that breaks the build"  
Know when to stop a.k.a "too much surgery kills the patient"
- let your code rest like when cooking steak
- rest != entropy
- novelists need time away from a manuscript before revision. you probably do too

## 6. Your Knowledge Portfolio
> Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets.
and
> Your ability to learn new things is your most important strategic asset.

Two things:
- how to learn
- what to learn

Building a knowledge portfolio
- invest regularly: learn continuously in small amounts
- diversify
- > The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change.
manage risk
- buy low, sell high: learn an emerging technology before it becomes popular
- review and rebalance

***Tip 9: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio***

Goals
- Learn at least one new language a year
    - I'm considering Rust or Elixir
- Read a technical book each month
- Read nontechnical books, too
    - I have this part covered lol
- Take classes
    - not any time soon
- Participate in local user groups and meetups
    - instead of user groups I've been getting involved in the [learningfromincidents.io](http://learningfromincidents.io) community
- Experiment with different environments
    - I'd like to do this more but I haven't been able to get over the short-term hit to my productivity
    - I mainly work in rubymine and occasionally use vim
- Stay current
    - I'm not great at this, I tend to get overwhelmed quickly

> The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things.

If you don't know the answer to something, take initiative to find out.

***Tip 10: Critically analyze what you read and hear***

## 7. Communicate!
You need to communicate to make your project successful

***Tip 11: English is just another programming language***

Know your audience
- don't just geek out at them
- https://daedtech.com/please-stop-geeking-out/
- answer their "so what?"
> Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.

Know what you want to say
- plan what you're gonna say
- for both writing and for speaking

Choose your moment
> "Is this a good time to talk about…?"

what will work for your audience???

Choose a style (for your audience)
Make it look good
formatting matters
reduce friction for your audience
it's a sign of respect

Involve your audience
> the documents we produce end up being less important than the process we go through to produce them

can approach it like pairing or PR review

Be a listener  
Get back to people
- or say you'll get back to them later

Tip 12: It's both what you say and the way you say it

Documentation  
Keep it with the code, it's a part of the code

***Tip 13: Build documentation in, don't bolt it on***  
- generate docs from your code comments
    - yard, pydoc, etc.
- restrict your non-API comments to the why, the purpose and goal
