I don't know about you, but it took me a long time to really get what some would consider to be really basic software operations concepts.

Before graduating from college, I never really thought about where software comes from.
This was before the STEM push and "learn to code" everywhere.
It's similar to how I took for granted that grocery stores had food--I never thought about how the food got there.

In general I was really sheltered from the development and maintainence of computer programs.
Once it mattered, it took me quite a while to really make sense of what was going on in software systems, especially in web services.
I heard words like "deploy" and "load balancer" and they didn't mean anything--until eventually they did.

I'd like to speed up that process for other students, learners, and early-career folks.
So here, have some notes.
