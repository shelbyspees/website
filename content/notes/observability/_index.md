title: "Notes on Observability"
draft: true
---

There are some fantastic resources out there discussing observability, or o11y for short.
I'll share a whole bunch here to start:

- o11y white paper
- o11y for developers
- mads o11y syllabus

My goal with these notes is to fill in some gaps that I've noticed, both in my own o11y journey and in the experiences of folks in the community.
