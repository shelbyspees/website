title: "Notes on Observability"
---

There are some fantastic resources out there discussing observability, or o11y for short.
These are a great place to start:

- [Honeycomb whitepaper: Achieving Observability](https://www.honeycomb.io/guide-achieving-observability/)*
- [Honeycomb whitepaper: Observability for Developers](https://www.honeycomb.io/guide-observability-for-developers/)*
- [DevOps measurement: Monitoring and observability](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-measurement-monitoring-and-observability)
- [Mads Hartmann's series on observability](https://mads-hartmann.com/series/observability/index.html)

\* Note: I've linked to whitepapers that are gated by a form to fill out in order to download them. If you want a direct link to the PDFs, reach out [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/shelbyspees) or at my work email (`shelby (at) honeycomb.io`) and I can get them to you.

My goal with these notes is to fill in some gaps that I've noticed, both from my own o11y journey and in the experiences of folks in the community.
