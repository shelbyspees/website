title: "SLO Book"

These are my notes I'm taking as I read through the new book from [Alex Hidalgo](https://twitter.com/ahidalgosre) et al., [Implementing Service Level Objectives](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/).

I was lucky to play a tiny part in the review process for this book, and I know for a fact that it's going to help many teams.
My notes here are mainly for my own benefit, but I hope you get something out of it.

Be sure to [order your physical copy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/) (but you can [read along online with a Safari account](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/) as well).
